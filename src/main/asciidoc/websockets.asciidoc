=== Websockets

Undertow provides support for Websockets out of the box. Undertow core provides a XNIO based API,
which uses the Xnio Channel interface to provide access to the web socket at a low level.

Most users will want a higher level interface than this, and to that end Undertow also provides a JSR-356
implementation. This implementation is part of a separate jar, to use it you must make sure that you have the
`undertow-servlet` and `undertow-websocket-jsr` artifacts on your class path. Servlet support is required because the
JSR-356 API is based on the Servlet API.

For maven users the following snippet should be added to your pom.xml:


[source%nowrap,xml]

  <groupId>io.undertow</groupId>
  <artifactId>undertow-servlet</artifactId>
  <version>${version.io.undertow}</version>
