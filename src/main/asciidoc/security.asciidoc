=== Security

Undertow has a flexible security architecture that provides several built in authentication mechanisms,
as well as providing an API to allow you to provide custom mechanisms. Mechanisms can be combined (as
much as the relevant specifications allow). This document covers the details of the core Undertow
security API. For details on how these are used in servlet deployments see link:../servlet/security.html[Servlet Security].

==== The SecurityContext

The core of Undertow's security architecture is the SecurityContext. It is accessible via the
`HttpServerExchange.getSecurityContext()` method. The security context is responsible for maintaining
all security related state for the request, including configured authentication mechanisms and the
current authenticated user.

==== Security Handlers

Security within Undertow is implemented as a set of asynchronous handlers and a set of authentication
mechanisms co-ordinated by these handlers.

Early in the call chain is a handler called `SecurityInitialHandler`, this is where the security processing
beings, this handler ensures that an empty `SecurityContext` is set on the current `HttpServerExchange`

* Allow authentication to occur in the call as early as possible.
* Allows for use of the mechanisms in numerous scenarios and not just for servlets.

The `SecurityContext` is responsible for both holding the state related to the currently authenticated user
and also for holding the configured mechanisms for authentication (`AuthenticationMechanism`) and providing 
methods to work with both of these. As this `SecurityContext` is replacable a general configuration
can be applied to a complete server with custom configuration replacing it later in the call.

After the `SecurityContext` has been established subseqeunt handlers can then add authentication mechanisms
to the context, to simplify this Undertow contains a handler called `AuthenticationMechanismsHandler`
this handler can be created with a set of `AuthenticationMechanism` mechanisms and will set them all on the
established `SecurityContext`.  Alternatively custom handlers could be used to add mechanisms one at a time
bases on alternative requirements.

The next handler in the authentication process is the `AuthenticationConstraintHandler`, this handler is
responsible for checking the current request and identifying if authentication should be marked as being
required for the current request. This handler can take a link:predicates-attributes-handlers.html[Predicate]
that makes a decision about if the request requires authentication.

The final handler in this chain is the `AuthenticationCallHandler`, this handler is responsible for
ensuring the `SecurityContext` is called to actually perform the authentication process, depending
on any identified constraint this will either mandate authentication or only perform authentication
if appropriate for the configured mechanisms.

There is no requirement for these handlers to be executed consecutively, the only requirement is that first
the `SecurityContext` is established, then the authentications and constrain check can be
performed in any order and finally the `AuthenticationCallHandler` must be used before any processing of
a potentially protected resource is called.

Security mechanisms that are to be used must implement the following interface: -

[source%nowrap,java]
----
public interface AuthenticationMechanism {

    AuthenticationMechanismOutcome authenticate(final HttpServerExchange exchange, final SecurityContext securityContext);

    ChallengeResult sendChallenge(final HttpServerExchange exchange, final SecurityContext securityContext);
}
----

The `AuthenticationMechanismOutcome` is used by the mechanism to indicate the status of the attempted authentication.

The three options are:

* **AUTHENTICATED** - The authentication was successful. No further methods will be tried and no challenge will be sent.

* **NOT_ATTEMPTED** - There was not enough information available to attempt an authentication. The next mechanism will be
tried. If this was the last mechanism and authentication is required then a challenge will be sent by calling the
`sendChallenge` method on all the mechanisms in order. If authentication is not required then the request will
proceed with no authenticated principal.

* **NOT_AUTHENTICATED** - The authentication failed, usually this is due to invalid credentials. The authentication process
will not proceed further, and a new challenge will be sent to the client.

Regardless of if authentication has been flagged as being required when the request reaches the `AuthenticationCallHandler` the
`SecurityContext` is called to commence the process.  The reason this happens regardless of if authentication is flagged as
required is for a few reasons:

* The client may have sent additional authentication tokens and have expectations the response will take these into account.
* We may be able to verify the remote user without any additional rount trips, especially where authentication has already occurred.
* The authentication mechanism may need to pass intermediate updates to the client so we need to ensure any inbound tokens are valid.

When authentication runs the `authenticate` method on each configured `AuthenticationMechanism` is called in turn, this continues
until one of the following occurs:

* A mechanism successfully authenticates the request and returns `AUTHENTICATED`.
* A mechanism attempts but does not complete authentication and returns `NOT_AUTHENTICATED`.
* The list of mechanisms is exhausted.

At this point if the response was `AUTHENTICATED` then the request will be allowed through and passed onto the next handler.

If the request is `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` then either authentication failed or a mechanism requires an additional round trip with the
client, either way the `sendChallenge` method of each defined `AuthenticationMethod` is called in turn and the response sent back
to the client.  All mechanisms are called as even if one mechanism is mid-authentication the client can still decide to abandon
that mechanism and switch to an alternative mechanism so all challenges need to be re-sent.

If the list of mechanisms was exhausted then the previously set authentication constraint needs to be checked, if authentication was
not required then the request can proceed to the next handler in the chain and that will be then of authentication for this request
(unless a later handler mandates authentication and requests authentication is re-atempted).  If however authentication was required
then as with a `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` response each mechanism has `sendChallenge` called in turn to generate an authentication challenge
to send to the client.
